            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p> 
                Outside of my academic pursuits in computer science, 
                I have a variety of interests that keep me active and entertained. 
                Swimming is one of my favorite pastimes, offering not only a great way to stay fit but also a refreshing break from studying.
                I also enjoy playing mobile games, which provide a fun and engaging way to unwind and challenge my strategic thinking skills. 
                Regular exercise is important to me, as it helps me maintain my physical health and mental well-being. Additionally,
                I love watching movies, which allow me to explore different stories and genres, providing both relaxation and inspiration.
                These hobbies not only bring balance to my life but also fuel my creativity and energy,
                contributing to my overall success as a student.
